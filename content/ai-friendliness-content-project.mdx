## Overview

As part of Uber’s **Enterprise Applications Knowledge Management** team, I led the design and implementation of an **agentic workflow** to measure and improve the **AI-readiness of internal content**.  

The project aimed to **make enterprise knowledge more accessible and actionable for internal AI search engines**—particularly Slack-based AI assistants and AI knowledge retrieval models—by ensuring that content is **consistently structured for machine interpretation**.

---

## Problem

Throughout 2025, Uber piloted several **AI Assistants** that helped employees **find information across internal systems** like UberHub, Google Drive, Confluence, and ServiceNow.  

Our team observed that these AI Assistants often **returned incomplete, innaccurate, or irrelevant results**, causing user confusion. 

One of the identified causes stemmed from content issues: due to variance across internal platforms, many knowledge resources had **inconsistent structure, unclear metadata, information chunking**, and other defects that made it difficult for LLM-based tools to extract context appropriately and generate accurate responses.  

Our challenge was to **quantify AI SEO friendliness** and then create a way to **systematically improve it** at scale.

---

## Goal

Create a **scalable, repeatable workflow** that could:

1. **Analyze** internal content against a formalized set of *AI SEO parameters* — structure, metadata, chunking, promptability, semantic density, etc.  
2. **Score** content based on weighted metrics defined in a new **AI SEO Guidelines**.  
3. **Provide recommendations** for improvement and help content owners revise their pages.  
4. **Ensure repeatability** so that re-running the same content should always yield the same score.

---

## Solution

I proposed and developed an **agentic workflow** utilizing **Uber's internal AI tools**. The workflow called multiple specialized AI agents that would:

- **Extract** content and metadata from various internal knowledge repositories.  
- **Evaluate** each article against weighted guideline parameters.  
- **Generate deterministic scores** and qualitative feedback.  
- **Output improvement recommendations**, such as restructuring sections, clarifying metadata, and improving headings or summaries.

> ### **Key differentiator**  
> The workflow produces **repeatable, deterministic scores**, ensuring consistency and traceability across content updates.

---

## Deliverables

- **Impact:** 70+ knowledge articles impacted in pilot phase.  
- **Guideline creation:** Contributed to the authoring of Uber’s first **AI SEO Guidelines Document**, defining measurable standards and weights.  
- **Agentic workflow:**: Designed a multi-agent pipeline for content ingestion, analysis, and consistent scoring.  
- **Improved user satisfaction**: Directly improved the performance of internal AI assistants, increasing both precision and user confidence in AI-generated responses.

---

## Next Steps

We are currently expanding the scope of the project to achieve the following:

- Automate ingestion of updated articles.  
- Extend scoring functionality to more knowledge repositories.  
- Embedd real-time AI-friendliness feedback within authoring tools.  
- Partner with other knowledge management teams to help them adopt the workflow in their documentation lifecycle.
- Build internal dashboards to visualize content improvements over time.

## Key Learnings

This project demonstrated how **technical writing, AI literacy, and workflow automation** converge to improve enterprise knowledge quality.  

By treating documentation as a **data product**, we enabled scalable, measurable, and repeatable improvement — setting a foundation for AI-driven documentation quality frameworks across Uber.
