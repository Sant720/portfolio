# 🧠 Agentic Workflow for AI-Friendliness Scoring and Optimization

**Summary:**  
Developed and piloted an agentic workflow that automatically analyzes, scores, and optimizes internal knowledge content for AI-readiness across Uber’s enterprise knowledge systems.

---

## Overview

As part of Uber’s **Enterprise Applications Knowledge Management** team, I led the design and implementation of an **agentic workflow** to measure and improve the **AI-friendliness** of internal content.  

The project aimed to make enterprise knowledge more accessible and actionable for internal generative AI systems—especially **Slack-based assistants and knowledge retrieval models**—by ensuring that content is structured, clear, and machine-interpretable.

---

## Problem

Uber was piloting a **Slack AI Assistant** that helped employees find information across internal systems like UberHub, Drive, and ServiceNow.  
However, we observed that the bot often **retrieved incomplete or irrelevant results** because much of the existing documentation wasn’t written in an **AI-friendly format**.  

Inconsistent structure, unclear metadata, and uneven tone made it difficult for LLM-based tools to extract context and generate accurate responses.  
Our challenge was to **quantify AI-friendliness** and then create a way to **systematically improve it** at scale.

---

## Goal

Create a **scalable, repeatable workflow** that could:

1. **Analyze** internal content against a formalized set of *AI-friendliness parameters* — clarity, structure, metadata, promptability, semantic density, etc.  
2. **Score** content based on weighted metrics defined in the **AI-Friendliness Guideline Document**.  
3. **Provide recommendations** for improvement and help content owners revise their pages.  
4. **Ensure repeatability** — re-running the same content should always yield the same score.

---

## Solution

I proposed and developed an **agentic workflow** composed of multiple specialized AI agents that:

- **Extract** content from UberHub using internal APIs.  
- **Evaluate** each article against weighted guideline parameters.  
- **Generate deterministic scores and qualitative feedback.**  
- **Output improvement recommendations**, such as restructuring sections, clarifying metadata, and improving headings or summaries.

> **Key differentiator:**  
> The workflow produces **repeatable, deterministic scores**, ensuring consistency and traceability across content updates.

---

## Implementation

- **Pilot scope:** 100+ GenAI-related UberHub articles.  
- **Guideline creation:** Authored Uber’s first **AI-Friendliness Guideline Document**, defining measurable standards and weights.  
- **Workflow architecture:** Designed a multi-agent pipeline for content ingestion, analysis, and scoring.  
- **Validation:** Partnered with content owners to test scoring accuracy and refine recommendations.  
- **Reporting:** Built dashboards to visualize content improvements over time.

## Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| **Average AI-Friendliness Score** | 52% | **95%+** | ▲ +43% |
| **Articles Processed** | — | 100+ | — |
| **Teams Impacted** | 1 (KM Pilot) | Expanding to HR, Legal, Payments | — |

This initiative directly improved the performance of internal AI assistants like **Slack AI Assistant** and **uSearch**, increasing both precision and confidence in AI-generated responses.

---

## Next Steps

We are expanding the workflow to other Uber knowledge domains:

- Automating ingestion of updated articles.  
- Extending scoring to **ServiceNow** and **Drive** repositories.  
- Embedding real-time AI-friendliness feedback within authoring tools.  
- Partnering with **HR, Legal, and Payments** KM teams to adopt the workflow in their documentation lifecycle.

---

## My Role

- Proposed and led the project based on observed retrieval challenges.  
- Authored the **AI-Friendliness Guideline Document**.  
- Designed the multi-agent architecture and scoring logic.  
- Managed pilot execution and stakeholder collaboration.  
- Reported key metrics and improvement results.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **UberHub Internal API** (content extraction)  
- **GenAI Agent Framework** ([insert tool name])  
- **Slack AI Assistant integration**  
- **Python** for orchestration & data handling  
- **[insert BI tool / dashboard framework]** for reporting and visualization

---

## Key Learnings

This project demonstrated how **technical writing, AI literacy, and workflow automation** converge to improve enterprise knowledge quality.  

By treating documentation as a **data product**, we enabled scalable, measurable, and repeatable improvement — setting a foundation for AI-driven documentation quality frameworks across Uber.
