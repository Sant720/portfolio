## Overview

As part of Uber’s **Enterprise Applications Knowledge Management** team, I led the design and implementation of an **agentic workflow** to measure and improve the **AI-readiness of internal content**.  

The project aimed to **make enterprise knowledge more accessible and actionable for internal AI search engines**—particularly Slack-based AI assistants and AI knowledge retrieval models—by ensuring that content is **consistently structured for machine interpretation**.

---

## Problem

Uber was piloting several **AI Assistants** that helped employees **find information across internal systems** like UberHub, Google Drive, Confluence, and ServiceNow.  

Our team observed that these AI Assistants often **returned incomplete, innaccurate, or irrelevant results**, causing user confusion. 

One of the identified causes stemmed from content issues: due to variance across internal platforms, many knowledge resources had **inconsistent structure, unclear metadata, information chunking**, and other defects that made it difficult for LLM-based tools to extract context appropriately and generate accurate responses.  

Our challenge was to **quantify AI SEO friendliness** and then create a way to **systematically improve it** at scale.

---

## Goal

Create a **scalable, repeatable workflow** that could:

1. **Analyze** internal content against a formalized set of *AI SEO parameters* — structure, metadata, chunking, promptability, semantic density, etc.  
2. **Score** content based on weighted metrics defined in a new **AI SEO Guidelines**.  
3. **Provide recommendations** for improvement and help content owners revise their pages.  
4. **Ensure repeatability** so that re-running the same content should always yield the same score.

---

## Solution

I proposed and developed an **agentic workflow** utilizing **Uber's internal AI tools**. The workflow called multiple specialized AI agents that would:

- **Extract** content from various platforms.  
- **Evaluate** each article against weighted guideline parameters.  
- **Generate deterministic scores and qualitative feedback.**  
- **Output improvement recommendations**, such as restructuring sections, clarifying metadata, and improving headings or summaries.

> **Key differentiator:**  
> The workflow produces **repeatable, deterministic scores**, ensuring consistency and traceability across content updates.

---

## Implementation

- **Pilot scope:** 80+ GenAI-related UberHub articles.  
- **Guideline creation:** Contributed to the authoring of Uber’s first **AI SEO Guideline Document**, defining measurable standards and weights.  
- **Workflow architecture:** Designed a multi-agent pipeline for content ingestion, analysis, and scoring.  
- **Validation:** Partnered with content owners to test scoring accuracy and refine recommendations.  
- **Reporting:** Built dashboards to visualize content improvements over time.

## Impact

<ImpactTable
  headers={["Metrics", "Before", "After", "Change"]}
  rows={[
    ["Average AI-Friendliness Score", "52%", <strong>95%+</strong>, "▲ +43%"],
    ["Articles Processed", "-", "100+", "-"],
    ["Teams Impacted", "1 (KM Pilot)", "Expanding to HR, Legal, Payments", "-"],
  ]}
/>

This initiative directly improved the performance of internal AI assistants like **Slack AI Assistant** and **uSearch**, increasing both precision and confidence in AI-generated responses.

---

## Next Steps

We are expanding the workflow to other Uber knowledge domains:

- Automating ingestion of updated articles.  
- Extending scoring to **ServiceNow** and **Drive** repositories.  
- Embedding real-time AI-friendliness feedback within authoring tools.  
- Partnering with **HR, Legal, and Payments** KM teams to adopt the workflow in their documentation lifecycle.

---

## My Role

- Proposed and led the project based on observed retrieval challenges.  
- Authored the **AI-Friendliness Guideline Document**.  
- Designed the multi-agent architecture and scoring logic.  
- Managed pilot execution and stakeholder collaboration.  
- Reported key metrics and improvement results.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **UberHub Internal API** (content extraction)  
- **GenAI Agent Framework** ([insert tool name])  
- **Slack AI Assistant integration**  
- **Python** for orchestration & data handling  
- **[insert BI tool / dashboard framework]** for reporting and visualization

---

## Key Learnings

This project demonstrated how **technical writing, AI literacy, and workflow automation** converge to improve enterprise knowledge quality.  

By treating documentation as a **data product**, we enabled scalable, measurable, and repeatable improvement — setting a foundation for AI-driven documentation quality frameworks across Uber.
